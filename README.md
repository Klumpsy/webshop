# webshop
Webshop I made to practise looping with Javascript. 

If you want an item to be on sale you can go to the item object on the top of the JavaScript file and change sale from "false" to "true"; 
If you want a different amount of discount then you can change the discount[x] to 0, 1 or 2 corresponding with the discount Array index. You can 
add more discount settings to the Array ofcourse. 

The code comments are in English but the language on the webshop page is in Dutch (sorry ;) )
